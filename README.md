## At a glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Two processors. ESP32 runs sensing and steering at ~50 Hz (nominal; effective rate unmeasured); Raspberry Pi 5 runs pillar detection. A stalled detector cannot stall the steering loop. |
| **Steering** | Single-servo Ackermann, 64-136 deg travel about a 106 centre (asymmetric, mat-tuned 2026-08-10), proportional on heading error at 1.0 servo-deg/deg with a 2 deg deadband — saturating at 42/30 deg of error |
| **Heading** | BNO055 absolute yaw. Corner detection is a *rising-edge* test on a side TF-Luna crossing 150 cm |
| **Range sensing** | 3x TF-Luna behind a PCA9548A I2C multiplexer (all three share address `0x10`) |
| **Pillar detection** | **Calibrated-Lab colour picker** — one (a,b) chroma disc per colour, sampled at the venue; the prior neural stack was superseded 2026-08-05 |
| **Why the neural stack lost** | `nanodet_lite` val decision accuracy **0.941** did not transfer to real footage — single-session, zero-clutter training data (a limit stated at training time, then observed) |
| **Validation** | 473 / 124 group-wise split, leakage-audited. 597 source images, **one lighting session**. |
| **Open Challenge** | Implemented — driven on the mat 2026-08-08/09 (test footage in [`other/`](other)); steering-sign fix + retune landed 2026-08-10 |
| **Obstacle Challenge** | ~~Implemented off-repo~~ **In-repo since 2026-08-06/07** — [`round2.py`](src/Round%202/round2.py) + [`main.cpp`](src/Round%202/main.cpp); radio compile-gated off (§11.10), I2C map verified (BNO on mux ch4) |
| **Drivetrain** | **Built and driven (final chassis — rebuild cancelled 2026-08-10)** — N20 via TB6612 through a LEGO differential; Ackermann steering. Pinion:crown counted 2026-08-11 (20:28 = 5:7); working-point currents still unmeasured. |

## Documentation index

Organised against the five criteria WRO uses to score engineering documentation.

| # | Criterion | Document | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Mobility & Mechanical Design | [`docs/1_mobility.md`](docs/1_mobility.md) | Steering + drive integrated, driven on the mat, retune 2026-08-10 documented; **chassis final (rebuild cancelled 2026-08-10)**; pinion:crown counted 2026-08-11 on the vehicle: 20:28 = 5:7 |
| 2 | Power & Sensor Architecture | [`docs/2_power_and_sensors.md`](docs/2_power_and_sensors.md) | Sensors and camera geometry documented; **power budget unmeasured** |
| 3 | Software Architecture & Obstacle Strategy | [`docs/3_software.md`](docs/3_software.md) | Open implemented (drives); Obstacle implemented, **in-repo since 2026-08-06/07**; competition stack at [`src/Round 2/competition/`](src/Round%202/competition/) since 2026-08-24 |
| 4 | Systems Thinking & Engineering Decisions | [`docs/4_systems_and_decisions.md`](docs/4_systems_and_decisions.md) | Decision log, rejected alternatives, risk register |
| 5 | Reproducibility & Repository Quality | [`docs/5_reproducibility.md`](docs/5_reproducibility.md) | Reproduction steps, licensing, versioning policy |
| — | **Engineering Journal (final, rev 3)** | [`docs/engineering_journal_final.pdf`](docs/engineering_journal_final.pdf) | 26 pp; describes the flashed competition configuration; matches the repository at `b715a4b` |
| — | Testing workflow | [`docs/tests.md`](docs/tests.md) | T1-T4 running; T5-T7 blocked on hardware |
| — | Detector reference | [`src/Round 2/detector/README.md`](src/Round%202/detector/README.md) | Results, operating point, reproduction |
| — | Firmware reference | [`src/README.md`](src/README.md) | Sketch-by-sketch |

**Start with [4 — Systems Thinking](docs/4_systems_and_decisions.md)** if you only
read one. It carries the decision log, including the alternatives that were built
and rejected and the numbers that killed them.

## Repository layout

```
docs/           five criterion documents + testing workflow + figure scripts
src/Round 1/    ESP32 firmware — heading hold, corner detection, steering
src/Round 2/    flight stack (round2.py + main.cpp + eval harness) + superseded detector (kept as evidence) + classical HSV pipeline
models/         CAD / printable parts        — team STLs (TF-Luna enclosure, steering horn, N20 clamp) + current chassis LEGO design + 69-step build instructions; third-party mounts cited, not redistributed
schemes/        electromechanical schematics — signal + power wiring v0.2 (generated)
t-photos/       team photos                  — official team photo present (Ch.7 requires one)
v-photos/       vehicle photos               — 6 views, refreshed 2026-08-11 (redesigned frame, Pi + camera mounted)
video/          performance video links      — LIVE 2026-08-12: Open 33 s + Obstacle 100 s (YouTube, unlisted-by-link)
other/          datasheets, setup notes
```

Empty directories are empty because the artifact does not exist yet, not because
it was overlooked. Each one says which.

## Quick start

**Run the superseded neural detector (kept runnable as iteration evidence):**

```bash
cd "src/Round 2/detector"
python decide_nanodet.py --camera 0 --window 5     # prints "left" or "right"
python decide_nanodet.py --image frame.jpg
python decide_nanodet.py --sweep                   # re-derive the operating point
```

**Reproduce every number in this repository from scratch:**
see [`docs/5_reproducibility.md`](docs/5_reproducibility.md#3-reproducing-the-detector-from-zero).

**Build and flash the firmware:** Arduino IDE or PlatformIO, board = ESP32.
Libraries: Adafruit BNO055, Adafruit Unified Sensor, Adafruit BusIO, ESP32Servo.

## Competition artifacts

| Artifact | Required | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 6 vehicle photos — every side, top and bottom | Yes | **Present, refreshed 2026-08-11** — `v-photos/`, the redesigned frame with Pi 5 and camera mounted. Replaces a 2026-08-05 set that showed the pre-redesign chassis |
| Team photo | Yes | **Present** — `t-photos/team_photo_official.jpg`. Chapter 7 requires "a team photo" (singular); an informal second photo is a repository-template convention and is outstanding |
| Performance video, >= 30 s autonomous driving, one per challenge | Yes | **Done 2026-08-12** — Open 33 s + Obstacle 100 s, unlisted-by-link, in [`video/video.md`](video/video.md) |
| Electromechanical schematic | Yes | **Present** — signal + power wiring v0.2 in `schemes/` (generated by a committed script; remaining unknowns drawn as TBD) |
| Control software | Yes | Present, `src/` |
| CAD / printable parts | Yes | **Present 2026-08-11/12** — team STLs (TF-Luna enclosure ×3-printed, steering horn, N20 clamp) + the **current chassis LEGO design file** and its 69-step build instructions in `models/chassis/`; camera-mount kit is third-party, cited not redistributed; MG90 is LEGO-integrated (no printed mount); no chassis STL because the redesign was in LEGO, not print (see D8) |

The pending rows are tracked here so the gap is visible rather than discovered
late.

## Version history

| Version | Date | Change | Problems it created or exposed |
|---|---|---|---|
| — | 2026-06-26 | Initial repo; ESP32 firmware — IMU heading hold, TF-Luna corner detection, ultrasonic prototype | Corner detection needed a rising-edge test; a level test re-fires and spins the vehicle |
| — | 2026-07-19 | HSV pillar pipeline v4.1, 0.43 ms/frame | Measured to fail in **both** directions, which voided the planned ROI-verifier fallback |
| — | 2026-07-26 | Trained NanoDet-Plus detector; vision moved under `Round 2` | Validation split found contaminated — 25 duplicate stems, 27/29 shared capture buckets. All prior numbers withdrawn and re-measured on a clean 473/124 split. |
| — | 2026-07-28 | Documentation restructured against the five scoring criteria | Root README had described the vehicle as camera-free after the detector had shipped |
| — | 2026-08-05 | Drive integrated (N20 / TB6612, append-only); calibrated-Lab picker declared the Round 2 stack; NanoDet superseded after field testing; signal-wiring schematic v0.1 added | The val-split winner did not survive real footage — the single-session dataset limit, stated at training time, was observed in practice |

Full reasoning for each entry: [`docs/4_systems_and_decisions.md`](docs/4_systems_and_decisions.md).

## Known limits

Stated here rather than left for a reader to find.

- **Every detector number rests on 597 images from a single lighting session**,
  with no other robots, spectators, banners or reflective flooring present. The
  figures are indicative, not a venue prediction — and field testing subsequently
  observed exactly this transfer failure (see the version history).
- **Both-pillar figures are synthetic composites.** No real image in the dataset
  contains a red and a green pillar at once.
- **No Raspberry Pi 5 latency figure exists for this model.** It will not be
  quoted until `benchncnn` has run on the target board.
- ~~**The Obstacle Challenge controller is not yet in this repository.** It is
  implemented and bench-tested off-repo; it lands after integration fixes.~~
  **Landed 2026-08-06/07** (`src/Round 2/round2.py` + `main.cpp`); this bullet
  was stale until 2026-08-10. [`docs/3_software.md`](docs/3_software.md) remains
  the specification of record.
- **The camera is a USB UVC webcam** — model **OMO/WCAM/11** (team-identified
  2026-08-08); field-of-view and angular-resolution figures are still pending a
  checkerboard measurement, so none is quoted.
- **The vehicle is built to Round-1 configuration.** The Raspberry Pi 5 and
  camera are not yet mounted. Drive bring-up (direction, duty, corner tests)
  ~~is unfinished~~ happened 2026-08-08/09; the chassis is final (rebuild
  cancelled 2026-08-10).
